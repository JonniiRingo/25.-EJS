E.js 
    - is dynamically embedding content based on requests so you don't have to manually write new files for every interaction. 
    - This is done using templating. Templating in the context of webdev has a different protocol then regular CS and c++
    - It also helps with seperation of concerns
    - In order to do this we need to use an embedding templating language and one of the ones for the mern stack is ejs and it ends in the 
        .ej file extension
    - We used to use res.send and that is only for static files. or ses.sendfile 
    - new method is res.render etc.
